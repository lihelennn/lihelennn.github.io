So this is the pitch!! :)))))

1. What it is

CityHunt is a mobile website designed to help people get to know their cities better.
Users can make or play different scavenger hunts in which players have to find and visit
real landmarks to proceed to the next level.

2. How it works

If a user makes a scavenger hunt, what they're really doing is entering it to our CityHunt database.
Each scavenger hunt has levels, which have the following structure: a level number, a hint, and coordinates.
When a user plays a hunt, they have to go to the place described in the hint and then click the "I am Here" button.
If their geolocation matches the coordinates for that level, they can move on to the next.

3. Intended Audience

The intended audience is everyone! Because we use coordinates for each level, the hunts can be located anywhere.
The options for locations are limitless, and so both tourists and locals can use it.
