					<h1>My Internship @ Samsara</h1>
					<h2>An Unconventional Start</h2>
					<p>
						With the unforunate consequences of the COVID-19 virus, my internship with Samsara was remote. I was still
						extremely thankful for the opportunity since I had previously heard of how amazing the engineers and internship experience
						was at Samsara. 
					</p>
				
					<h2>Goals for the internship</h2>
					<ul>
					  <li>To continue learning more software engineering technology to improve my technical skills. With some other internships under
						  my belt, I had a better picture of what the day-to-day of a software engineer was like. A main goal for my internship 
						  with Samsara was to be able to learn new technologies and taking ownership of a project.
					  </li>
				  	<li>
						Making an impact on Samsara and its users. I am especially motivated when I know that my project is making an impact on the company 
						or end users. I hoped to be able to take ownership of a project, especially as a full-stack engineering intern. I wanted 
						to learn from others while also being able to work independently to create something meaningful.
					  </li>
					  <li>
						Learning and collaborating. I wanted to get to know other engineers, product managers, designers, and more! I wanted to collaborate 
						with individuals from my team or outside my team, and I am motivated to work with different people to leran from them. At a 
						company at Samsara's size, I wanted to get to know others and contribute to a healthy and thriving engineering culture.
					  </li>
					</ul>
					<h2>My Project</h2>
					<h3>Problem</h3>
					  <p>
						At Samsara, their goal is to make it easier for fleet companies easily manage their trucks and drivers. 
						Whenever unsafe events, such as harsh braking or collisions, come into Samsara's system, Samsara 
						allows their customers to assign coaches to those safety events. However, especially with large enterprise customers,
						it may be a tedious process to have to manually assign those coaches. It can take time, effort, and be the bottleneck 
						to an efficient coaching workflow.
					  </p>
						<h3>Purpose</h3>
						  <p>The purpose of my project was to platform where drivers can be given specific and explicit coach assignments. From there,
							  we can use those assignments to then automatically assign coaches to safety events that come in. 
						<h3>Process</h3>
						  <p>Since this was a full-stack project, there were some UI components and some backend logic that had to be implemented.<br>
							I was also very lucky to have support from my mentor, manager, and other team members. I was also able to work closely with the product manager 
							and designer for my team.
						  </p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>
					      Design Document
					      <ul>
					        <li>
					          I kicked the project off by reviewing my design document. This was a document illustrating the purpose, stakeholders, the architecture,
					          design, dependencies, security concerns, etc. involved in my project.
					        </li>
					      </ul>
					    </li>
					    <li>
						  User Interface 
						  <ul>
							  <li>
								  Implementing workflows and designs created by designers. 
							  </li>
							  <li>
								  Participating in design review sessions to gather/give feedback.
							  </li>
						  </ul>
					      
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      Backend
					      <ul>
							<li>
								Spinning up my own database and microservice using Samsara's infrastructure.
							  </li>
					        <li>
					          Using Go to learn about RPC endpoints.
					        </li>
	
					        
					      </ul>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      Testing
					      <ul>
					        <li>
					          I constantly had to test my code by writing unit tests, testing changes locally and on sandbox, or using internal tools to query databases for any changes.
					        </li>
					    
					      </ul>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							Customer Calls
						  </li>

					<h1>My Internship @ Square</h1>
					<h2>Getting settled in</h2>
					<p>
					  When I heard that I got an offer from <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a>, I was super excited! It’s also so awesome to get an offer to
					  work at such a top-notch but still small tech company. But I had to go to Atlanta. I barely knew anything about
					  this place. But I knew that opportunities like these were hard to come by, so I decided to give it a shot.
					</p>
					<p>
					  When I first got here, things were so hectic. I had to get my room cleaned, go to Walmart to buy everything,
					  make sure I fed myself, and prepared myself for work the next day. I was one of the five interns in the Atlanta
					  office, and the only intern on the Payment Acceptance team. My team basically handled the many payments that come into Square every second. Sounds important huh? Especially knowing that a big part of Square is the POS that takes all the credit card payments. On my first day, I met with my manager about my goals for the internship and looked over some UI code.

					<h2>Goals for the internship</h2>
					<ul>
					  <li>Getting a feel for what it is like to work at a tech company. This was my first real internship, so learning
					    about the best engineering practices, what it looks like to write good documentation and code, how to handle
					    code review, all that good stuff.
					  </li>
				  	<li>
					    Learning about the engineering that happens at Square specifically. At Square One (Square's orientation),
					    I learned so much about the awesome technology that help accomplish Square's mission of <i>empowering the underprivileged</i>.
					    Whether it is POS (Point of Sale), Square Cash, Captial, or anything else, it is so cool that one company
					    can have so many subdivisions/businesses to serve its mission.
					  </li>
					  <li>
					    Doing full-stack development! My previous experience included a lot of middleware/frontend UI work, and I really
					    wanted to be exposed to the magic that happens in the backend. I also still love web dev because that is something
					    that I've been exposed to since my senior year of high school, so that would be interesting to keep exploring.
					  </li>
					</ul>
					<p>
					  I was very lucky to have a project scoped out for me that was pretty much perfect in terms of what I'd work on.
					</p>
					<h2>My Project</h2>
					<h3>Problem</h3>
					  <p>
					    At Square, whenever there are changes, payment processing partners want to ensure that the changes correct. In order to do this, they send
						  test cases for "Certification."
						  However, this certification process can actually be very difficult. It requires over ten steps and can be very time-consuming and complicated
						  to understand
					  </p>
						<h3>Purpose</h3>
						  <p>The purpose of my project was to create a tool an internal tool that the Payment Acceptance team owns. This tool would allow users to create new
						    batches (batches are groups of payments that come into Square) that can be sent out so that we can get back batch fies about the payments
						    in the batch. Those batches are normally stored and encrypted somewhere and then sent to the payment processing partner, so creating a tool
						    that can get back the batch files unencrypted and not send it to the payment processing partners (since these are only for testing purposes
						    and we do not actually want the partners to process these test payments) would make the certification process much easier!
						<h3>Process</h3>
						  <p>Since this was a full-stack project, there were some UI components and some backend logic that had to be implemented.<br>
						    I was also very lucky to have support from my mentor and manager. My mentor was my first point of contact / check-in if I had any questions,
						    and I also met with my manager biweekly to discuss any problems/blockages
						  </p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>
					      Design Document
					      <ul>
					        <li>
					          I kicked the project off by writing a design document. This was a document illustrating the purpose, stakeholders, the architecture,
					          design, dependencies, security concerns, etc. involved in my project.
					        </li>
					      </ul>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      User Interface (so glad that I had a few warmup assignments to improve the existing UI of the internal interface because that helped me understand
					      what was happening and how I can make changes / add things to the interface)
					      <ul>
					        <li>
					          Adding a new tab to the internal tool so that someone can use this tool
					        </li>
					        <li>
					          Creating filters and tables so that users can view the recent payments so that they know what payments they want their "test batch" to have
					        </li>
					        <li>
					          Displaying the payments that are added to the new batch
					        </li>
					      </ul>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      Backend
					      <ul>
					        <li>
					          Lerning about RPC endpoints that are in the internal tool and learning how to create new classes for new RPC endpoints
					        </li>
					        <li>
					          Learning about dependency injections (<a hred="https://github.com/google/guice">Guice</a>) and Data Defintion Languages (DDL - <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Protocol Buffers</a>)
					          <ul>
					            <li>
					              I also struggled with this a lot at first but gained a better understanding of these as I worked on a warmup task and as I continued to work through this
					              project.
					            </li>
					          </ul>
					        </li>
					        <li>
					          Learning about the payment flow technology that happen at Square, and make modifications to them so that I can create my tool.
					          <ul>
					            <li>
					              Super confusing when I had no clue what was going on, but eventually got the hang of things :)
					            </li>
					          </ul>
					        </li>
					      </ul>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      Testing
					      <ul>
					        <li>
					          I constantly had to push my code to staging to test out changes.
					        </li>
					        <li>
					          Also wrote a few test files for the backend code that I added / modified.
					        </li>
					      </ul>
					    </li>
					  </ul>
					<h3>Final Product & Takeaways</h3>
					  During the last few weeks, pull requests were created, code was reviewed, changes were made, and finally, my code was merged into ~master~! This tool
					  is expected to be used in staging (and production if necessary).
					  <br><br>
					  During my last week, I had a final 30-minute presentation to the Payment team in Atlanta, along with a few other folks from the San Francisco office.
					  I also presented a 5-minute demo during the bigger demos meeting between all Payment teams at Square.
					  <br><br>
					  I was overall really glad that I was able to complete the project in time and create a tool that would save Square teams time and frustration.
					  Besides learning about the Square payment flow and all the technical work that goes into maintaining the services, I also felt like I was able to improve
					  my presentation soft skills! I am so grateful that my team was so supportive throughout the entire internship, always being there to answer my questions
					  and make my internship experience comfortable but also full of learning.

					<h2>
					  Highlights of Atlanta
					</h2>
					  <ul>
					    <li>
					      I was able to join an ultimate frisbee women's team (Atlanta Outbreak) here! I also played in summer league after work on Tuesdays/Thursdays sometimes
					      if it was not rainy. Everyone was super friendly. Outbreak had weekend practices, and we also went to three weekend tournaments throughout the summer (2 in Atlanta,
					      and 1 in Boyds, Maryland).
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      The other interns and I were told that Savannah was a beautiful place to visit. Even though I couldn't drive, two of the other interns could, so we rented
					      a car and drove out early (5 AM) in the morning. It turned out the other interns drove us through Montgomery, Alabama, and we ended up Pensacola Beach, Florida.
					      They knew where they were going...I didn't because they wanted it to be a surprise.
					      <ul>
					        <li>
					          No regrets here though! This was super fun, and we were able to hang by the beach for a few hours before we drove back for 5 hours through some major lightning and thunder...
					        </li>
					      </ul>
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      On July 4, the other interns and I went to SIX FLAGS OVER GEORGIA. I had never been to Six Flags before (in fact, I have not been on any crazy rollar coasters before), and
					      this was a crazy experience. We went on some crazy rides (some rated 8 to 9 out of 10 by rollar coaster raters)
					    </li>
					    <li>
					      My sisters came to ATL and visited me! Explored the World of Coke and aquarium.
					    </li>

					  </ul>

					<h2>
					  Fun facts
					</h2>
					<ul>
					  <li>I took 100+ Lyfts the entire summer. I had to go to work, come home from work (I'd walk back sometimes, but rarely), go to some frisbee practices/games,
					    and had to go to the other interns' apartment to hang out sometimes. I really wish I could drive, but good thing Lyfts were not to expensive in Atlanta.
					    <i>phew!</i>
					  </li>
					  <li>
					    Square's Atlanta office is in Atlatic Station, which is pretty close to GA Tech. I lived on the west side of Georgia Tech.
					  </li>
					  <li>
					    GA Tech's campus was absolutely beautiful! One night with the other interns, I was able to go to the top of one of the buildings to sit and watch the sunset!
					    So beautiful.
					  </li>
					  <li>
					    The weather would be beautiful when I get into work, but as the day went on, it would get dark and show signs of thunderstorm/lightning. It rained
					    so much this summer, and it was always a full-on downpour/thunderstorm. This was unexpected.
					  </li>
					</ul>
